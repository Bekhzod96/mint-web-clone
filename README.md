#HTML Forms

##MintSignUp

In this project, you’ll get a chance to rebuild the form used by Mint.com for signing up new users. They have been highly praised for the design and simplicity of their site, and their signup process is very clean.

This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.com’s signup page.

Additional Microverse Requirements

**General**:+1:
The page is very straightforward, so you should be able to clone it even if your CSS skills aren’t perfect. As usual, don’t worry about any of the dynamic functionality on the page or finding the specific icons they use or having the form actually submit. The point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
